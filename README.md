# Airline_Reservation_System
 
*An interactive database application designed to manage and streamline airline operations, including flight scheduling, passenger bookings, and staff management.*  

**Project Overview**:  
Developed an SQL-based **Airline Reservation System** to handle essential airline operations like flight management, booking reservations, and passenger data tracking. The project includes a robust database design using **Normalization** techniques to maintain data integrity and enforce relationships using **foreign key constraints**.  

**Key Features**:  
- **Flight Management**: Tracks flight schedules, availability, departure, and arrival times across multiple airports.  
- **Booking System**: Manages seat reservations, fare calculations, and passenger information.  
- **Staff Assignment**: Assigns roles (pilots, cabin crew) to flights and maintains employee records.  
- **Data Analytics**: Generates reports on flight occupancy, total bookings, and revenue.  
- **Security**: Ensured data consistency using primary and foreign keys, and handled sensitive passenger details securely.  

**Technical Stack**:  
- **Database**: MySQL (Schema design, normalization, complex queries using JOINs, GROUP BY, and subqueries).  
- **Languages**: SQL (DDL, DML, and DCL operations).  
- **Tools**: SQL Workbench  for database management.  

**Key Contributions**:  
- Designed and implemented a relational database with 4+ interrelated tables to model real-world airline operations.  
- Wrote optimized queries to handle flight schedules, seat availability, and fare calculations.  
- Developed **updateable and scalable structures** to support future features, like loyalty programs and bookings.
